# S2c parity divergences — service group

Every known place where the S2c ports differ from the shipping
`prisma-cli`. Same entry format as `parity-divergences.md`; S2d
consolidates the per-slice files. The S1 whoami-scoped record and the
engine-global divergences (json framing, channel discipline, `--quiet`
as a log-level alias, dropped `--trace`, shared flag family, errored
settlements exit 2) apply to every command here and are not repeated.

## Dispatch 1 — service group core (build, show, open, list-deploys, show-deploy, domain add/show/remove/retry/wait)

### The rename (R-S2c-1), one entry per command

`app` ports as `service` — paths, ids, help, presenters, error copy,
flags, positionals. No alias; the legacy `app` spellings do not exist
in the v8 tree.

| Legacy invocation | v8 invocation | Also renamed on this command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prisma-cli app build [app]` | `prisma-cli service build [service]` | positional `[app]` → `[service]`; error copy "App build/app" → "Service build/service" |
| `prisma-cli app show [app]` | `prisma-cli service show [service]` | `--app <name>` → `--service <name>`; result field `app` → `service` |
| `prisma-cli app open [app]` | `prisma-cli service open [service]` | `--app` → `--service`; result field `app` → `service` |
| `prisma-cli app list-deploys [app]` | `prisma-cli service list-deploys [service]` | `--app` → `--service`; result field `app` → `service` |
| `prisma-cli app show-deploy <deployment>` | `prisma-cli service show-deploy <deployment>` | result field `app` → `service` |
| `prisma-cli app domain add <hostname> [app]` | `prisma-cli service domain add <hostname> [service]` | `--app` → `--service`; result fields `app`/`appId` → `service`/`serviceId` |
| `prisma-cli app domain show <hostname> [app]` | `prisma-cli service domain show <hostname> [service]` | same as domain add |
| `prisma-cli app domain remove <hostname> [app]` | `prisma-cli service domain remove <hostname> [service]` | same, plus consent question "Detach … from App …?" → "… from Service …?" |
| `prisma-cli app domain retry <hostname> [app]` | `prisma-cli service domain retry <hostname> [service]` | same as domain add |
| `prisma-cli app domain wait <hostname> [app]` | `prisma-cli service domain wait <hostname> [service]` | same as domain add |

- Command ids follow: `app.domain.add` → `service.domain.add`, etc.
- Env override rename: `PRISMA_APP_ID` → `PRISMA_SERVICE_ID` (domain
  target selection; `PRISMA_PROJECT_ID` unchanged). The legacy name is
  NOT read in v8.
- NOT renamed: `prisma.compute.ts` keys (`app:`/`apps:` are
  SDK-owned; rename needs @prisma/compute-sdk coordination — flagged
  for the operator), and the shared local state file's internal keys
  (`state.json`'s `app.selectedByProject` — the store is still shared
  with the legacy shell until S2d).

### Error-code mapping (flat → dotted `SERVICE.*`)

Every errored settlement exits 2 (engine rule; the legacy exit-1
errors below change as a class). `fix` prose maps to a `user-choice`
nextAction — appended after the legacy typed `nextActions` when an
error carries both (e.g. `PROJECT_SETUP_REQUIRED`), so no advice is
lost; command-shaped `nextSteps` map to `run-command` nextActions
with the renamed `service` spelling.

Rename inside ported error prose: command lines (`prisma-cli app …` →
`prisma-cli service …`) and the "app target" noun rename;
prose that names the SDK-owned config entries deliberately keeps
`app` — `defineComputeConfig({ app })` and
`ComputeConfigTargetUnknownError`'s "this config defines a single
app." refer to the `prisma.compute.ts` `app:`/`apps:` keys, which do
not rename until the compute-sdk coordination lands (decided, not an
accident of the substitution list).

### Auth (Q1 class)

The service group's legacy commands never auto-logged-in
(`requireComputeAuth`); v8 keeps that: `needs.credentials` settles
unauthenticated runs with the engine's `CLI.CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`
(exit 2) instead of the legacy `AUTH_REQUIRED` (exit 1).

### `service domain remove` consent (Q5 class + OPEN QUESTION)

- Interactive decline: legacy `USAGE_ERROR` "Custom domain removal
  canceled" (exit 2) → v8 user cancellation (exit 3).
- Non-interactive without a grant: legacy `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`
  (exit 1) → engine `CLI.CONSENT_REQUIRED` (exit 2).
- **`--yes` no longer grants the removal.** Legacy skipped the
  confirmation under `-y/--yes`. The engine rules consent structurally
  ungrantable by `--yes` (pinned engine test: "--yes can never grant
  consent"), reserves the `yes` flag name, and hides shared-flag
  values from handlers, so R-S2b-3's "keep the current confirmation
  flag" cannot be built for this command without an engine amendment.
  Built to the engine rule; as of D1 the command is interactive-only.
  RAISED TO THE OPERATOR as a contradiction between R-S2b-3 and the
  engine's consent semantics (affects `service remove`, `service
  deploy --prod`, and S2b's `--yes`-consent commands identically).

### Interactive service picker

The legacy picker errored with per-command `USAGE_ERROR` copy in
non-interactive contexts and when a saved selection went stale
non-interactively. In v8 the engine prompt settles those runs with the
structural `CLI.PROMPT_REQUIRED` error (R-S2b-6); a stale saved
selection falls through to the picker in both modes.

### `service open` browser launch (BLOCKED partial)

The legacy command opened the live URL whenever prompting was allowed
(TTY + not CI + not `--json`). The ruled v8 mechanism is the
engine-supplied interactivity fact `ctx.interactive` (S2b operator
decision 3); that engine amendment has not landed, so D1 ships the
command reporting the URL (endpoint event + `opened: false` + URL as
the stdout payload line) WITHOUT ever launching the browser. The
handler reads the future `ctx.interactive` field defensively and picks
the behavior up automatically once the amendment lands. Divergence
until then: interactive runs no longer open the browser.

### `service build`

- Gains engine progress events: `step-started`/`step-finished` around
  the build, an `artifact` event for the output directory, and
  per-line `output` events tapped from the SDK build runner
  (`BuildCommandIo.onOutput`, wired through a new optional `io`
  parameter on `executeAppBuild`/`resolveAppBuildStrategy`; legacy
  callers unaffected). Legacy printed no live build output.
- `--build-type` values are engine-enum-validated at parse time
  (usage error exit 2, engine copy) instead of the legacy
  commander/controller split.
- Legacy `nextSteps: ["prisma-cli app deploy"]` becomes the
  `run-command` nextAction `prisma-cli service deploy`.

### `service domain wait`

- Now a result command with engine `status` events (one per status
  change, `from`/`status`/`data.domainId`/`data.elapsedMs`) instead of
  the legacy streaming stderr lines / per-poll json events; json mode
  frames each status change exactly once (legacy emitted an event per
  poll cycle in json mode, including unchanged statuses).
- Success now settles with a result envelope
  (`{…target, hostname, status: "active", liveUrl}`); legacy ended
  with only the streaming success wrapper event.
- Poll interval still honors `PRISMA_CLI_DOMAIN_WAIT_POLL_MS`
  (default 5s); `--timeout` grammar unchanged (default `15m`, `0` =
  single check).

### Result shape changes (all commands)

- `verboseContext` (the `--verbose` "Local context" block and json
  field) is dropped — `--verbose` is a log-level alias in v8 and is
  not otherwise retained (S2 ruling 7).
- `service list-deploys` json result is the plain
  `{projectId, service, deployments}` record; the legacy
  `items`/`count` list-serializer wrapper does not port.
- Domain results drop the `branch.id` field (legacy emitted
  `branch: {id, name, kind}` with `id` always `null` for domain
  commands; v8 emits `branch: {name, kind}`).
- Human output: whoami-style summary + field rows (and a table for
  list-deploys) on stderr; these commands write no stdout payload in
  human mode except `service open`, which now prints the URL as its
  stdout payload line (pipe-clean; legacy printed nothing on stdout).

### Fixture mode

Legacy app commands refused to run in fixture mode
(`FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` via `ensurePreviewAppMode`). The v8 tree has no
fixture mode, so the refusal path does not port (fixture machinery
dies in S2d).
